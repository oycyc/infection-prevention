## to do
- mobile orientation change call resizing function again
- place a bunch of defenders one row and enemy doesn't get damaged until x position passed 
- in defenders.js, change chooseDefender and Defender class to input this.chosenDefender as a parameter instead of using global variable

- change every function from "handlexyz" to "updatechampionframe"

- if in idle, slower update frame
- remove the arms from vaccine head

- powerups ask trivia question cooldown
